Node Red GFConnect
===========

### About
Node Red GFConnect is a Node-RED flow for controlling the Grainfather Connect (G30) brewing system from Raspberry Pi. It can be used as a replacement for the official Grainfather App.

The following features are currently supported:
* Temperature control
* Pump control
* Heating power control
* Timer control (set, stop, pause, resume)
* Delayed heat control (set, stop, pause, resume)
* Loading of brew session from Brewfather batch json files
* Sending timer and brew alerts as push notifications via Pushover

### Dependencies
* node-red-dashboard
* node-red-contrib-ui-level
* node-red-contrib-generic-ble
* node-red-node-rbe

### Brew Sessions

In order to start a brew session you first need to establish a connection between the Grainfather controller and GF Connect. Then you navigate to the Brewfather File upload panel and upload the batch json file you have downloaded from the [Brewfather](https://web.brewfather.app/tabs/batches) brew planner website.

Once you click the "Upload" button, the recipe will be sent to the Grainfather controller and you can start brewing:

You will now be able to control the brew session from the GFConnect panel or from the Grainfather controller.

### Configuring Push Notifications

GF Connects support push notifications which are delivered via the Pushover App.

To set up push notifications for brew events, e.g. when a timer expires, you will need to enter your Pushover user key and API key into the Notification settings. You will need to register for a new API Key in Pushover. It is also possible to use a group key instead of a user key so more than one user can receive the notifications.

The Pushover keys are avaliable through the [Pushover Dashboard](https://pushover.net/)
